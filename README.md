# I'm Not Hacker Terminal

Welcome to I'm Not Hacker Terminal! This is an open-source development platform designed as a web terminal, aimed at empowering developers and enthusiasts to create and enhance their own terminal experience by writing JavaScript code.

Our goal is to foster a collaborative environment where users can contribute to the development of this terminal. By leveraging GitHub's raw file feature, we allow users to upload and run custom scripts seamlessly.

Additionally, we will be introducing a dedicated Plugins section, inviting everyone to contribute their unique functionalities and enhancements to the terminal.

Join us in this exciting journey to build and innovate together! For more information and detailed guides, please visit our Wiki.

Happy coding!
